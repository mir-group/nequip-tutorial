# Nequip Tutorial

This is a tutorial for NequIP, an architecture for building highly accurate and scalable Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) and deploy them in production simulations. The ideas are described [in this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05249) while the latest framework is detailed [in this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16068). We have released an open-source package implementing NequIP and this tutorial serves as a simple introduction to the NequIP code.
